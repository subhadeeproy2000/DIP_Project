# DIP_Project
I tried to work in deep learning concept to track vehicles and then count number of vehicles in a particular video clip at a time instant.
I have given mainly focus on Harr Cascade Classifier model and Deep Learning YOLO model for our project. I have tried to implement both the methods in the algorithm to track the vehicles. We have analyzed which one was the most effective in vehicle detection between both the methods. 
I have checked the algorithm in the real time video also to check the effectiveness of both the methods.
